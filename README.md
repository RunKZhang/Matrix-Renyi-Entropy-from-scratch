# Renyi Entropy From Scratch
This is a from scratch numpy implementation for the Renyi Entropy, Renyi Joint Entropy, Renyi Mutual Information, and Renyi Total Correlation in paper entitled "Multivariate Extension of Matrix-based R ́ enyi’s α-order Entropy Functional".

This toy-level repo is used for example implementation, there are potential numerical errors for the calculation of eigenvalues of normalized positive definite matrix. 

For now, the implementation is based on numpy and its linalg package, happy to hear that you can propose a better results.
